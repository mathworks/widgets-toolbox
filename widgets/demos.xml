   <description>Widgets Toolbox helps you efficiently develop advanced user interfaces in MATLAB and App Designer. Widgets combine existing control functionalities together into larger, reusable, common functionality to accelerate development of graphical user interfaces. 

 Components include: 

Grid of buttons grouped together
List of checkboxes and labels grouped together
Color selector control
Date and time selector
File selection control, consisting of a label, edit field, and browse button
Listbox control combined with a label and a set of buttons for managing the list composition and ordering
Password field with hidden text
Progress bar indicator with time remaining and cancel button
Slider control group with labels and enable/disable checkboxes
Slider control linked to a numeric spinner and edit field
List of tasks with icons indicating status (pass, fail, running, complete, etc.)
Toolbar with advanced layout functionality that can appear like a toolstrip

This version of Widgets Toolbox is intended for NEW development of uifigure or App Designer apps starting from R2020b or newer releases.

If you have an existing MATLAB app using Widgets Toolbox 1.x content, you may also need "Widgets Toolbox (Compatibility Support)".
