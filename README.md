Widgets Toolbox helps you efficiently develop advanced user interfaces in MATLAB and App Designer. Widgets combine existing control functionalities together into larger, reusable, common functionality to accelerate development of graphical user interfaces. 

Components include: 

- Grid of buttons grouped together
- List of checkboxes and labels grouped together
- Color selector control
- File selection control, consisting of a label, edit field, and browse button
- Listbox control combined with a label and a set of buttons for managing the list composition and ordering
- Password field with hidden text
- Progress bar indicator with time remaining and cancel button
- Slider control group with labels and enable/disable checkboxes
- Slider control linked to a numeric spinner and edit field
- List of tasks with icons indicating status (pass, fail, running, complete, etc.)
- Toolbar with advanced layout functionality that can appear like a toolstrip
- Contextual pane that can switch contents (similar to card panel, tab panel, uitab)

Additional object-oriented code components provide enable you to work more efficiently developing advanced apps using a modular hand-code approach. You can use model-view-controller or a similar separated presentation architecture.

- Application superclasses for managing single or multiple session files
- Preference management
- Superclasses for model-view-controller implementation

This version of Widgets Toolbox is intended for NEW development of uifigure or App Designer apps starting from R2021a or newer releases.

If you have an existing MATLAB app using Widgets Toolbox content developed prior to R2020b, you may also need "Widgets Toolbox (Compatibility Support)".
